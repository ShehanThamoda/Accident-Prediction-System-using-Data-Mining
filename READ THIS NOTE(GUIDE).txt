**********************Accident Prediction System**************************

1)In this system, we trained data using SMOreg algorithm.
2)We input the Location_Easting_OSGR,Location_Northing_OSGR,Longitude, Latitude,Number_of_Vehicles and Number_of_Casualties. 
3)Trained by according to the Longitude and Latitude seperately.
4)Update the class paths in the code according to your computer file paths such as smoreg_values.txt,smoreg_accuracy.txt,chrome driver paths.

*****Run the Main Window*******
1)First click "Enter the System" button.
2)After click "Open Data Set" button and select the file which is newtraindata.csv.arff
3)Then click "Test Data Set" button and select the file which is newtestdata2.csv.arff
4)After click the "Train the dataset" button. If click this button training data set match with the sample test data set on webpage.
5)After the process indicate the places on map which are predict to accident in near future.
6)Then move to the java interface again and finally can see the accurasy, click "Check Accurasy" button on java interface.
